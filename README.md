# Diabetes Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of the diabetes dataset, with a particular emphasis on evaluating K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classification models. We explore how these models' performance varies depending on dataset characteristics, data cleaning strategies, and the introduction of variable segmentation, specifically for the Body Mass Index (BMI) feature.

## Datasets
- **Uncleaned Dataset:** The raw diabetes dataset can be found in `diabetes.csv`. This dataset represents the starting point for our analysis.

- **Cleaned Dataset:** The dataset after thorough data cleaning is available as `diabetesinfo_cleanednew.csv`. This cleaned version forms the basis for our subsequent modeling and analysis.

- **Cleaned Dataset with BMI Ranges:** We further segmented the BMI variable into distinct ranges, creating `CleanNewDiabetes_with_BMI_range.xlsx`. This dataset allows us to explore the influence of BMI categories on model performance.

## Code
All code implementations for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling are written in Python. You can find the code for this project in the main PDF report, titled "report.pdf."

For more detailed insights and results, please refer to the report.

**Note:** For replicating the project, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed and access to the provided datasets.

Thank you for exploring our diabetes dataset analysis project!
